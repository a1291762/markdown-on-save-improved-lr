Markdown + WordPress = writing bliss.

== Description ==

*This plugin is deprecated*. Use the much-better-supported and more-frequently-updated Markdown module in [Jetpack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/), by the same author. This plugin will not receive any updates or support from here on out.

WordPress will process your post with Markdown unless you tell it not to. You probably won't want to, since writing in Markdown is so awesome. Compatible with mobile apps and 3rd-party blogging tools.

The main difference between this plugin and the [original](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/markdown-on-save/) is that this plugin assumes you always want Markdown processing.

The markdown version is stored separately (in the `post_content_formatted` column), so you can deactivate this plugin and your posts won't spew out Markdown, because HTML is stored in the `post_content` column, just like normal. This is also much faster than doing on-the-fly Markdown conversion on every page load. It's only done once! When you re-edit the post, the markdown version is swapped into the editor for you to edit.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `markdown-on-save-improved` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the "Markdown On Save Improved" plugin in your WordPress administration interface
3. Create a new post with Markdown.
4. Your post can be edited using Markdown, but will save as processed HTML on the backend.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What made you retire this plugin? =

Plain and simple: I get paid to write and maintain the Jetpack version. It gets used by a lot more people and gets regular bug fixes. There are even support people who will help you if you have problems!

If you liked MoSI, you'll love the Jetpack Markdown module. It's even easier to use - just enable it for a blog and every post is just converted to Markdown. There are tons of edge case fixes, improved GitHub-Flavoured syntax additions, better revision handling, and more.

= How do I use Markdown syntax? =

Please refer to this resource: [PHP Markdown Extra](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/).

= How do I disable Markdown processing? =

In most cases this should be unnecessary, since Markdown ignores existing HTML. But if Markdown for some reason disturbs your HTML when making an edit to a non-Markdown post, either check the "Disable Markdown formatting" checkbox, or put a `<!--no-markdown-->` HTML comment in your post somewhere (useful when using a mobile or 3rd party blogging app).

= How do I enable Markdown processing on a custom post type? =

Just add `add_post_type_support( 'your-post-type', 'markdown-osi' );` to your [functionality plugin](http://wpcandy.com/teaches/how-to-create-a-functionality-plugin/) `functions.php` file. Note that it must be hooked to the `init` action like this:

	add_action( 'init', 'your_prefix_add_markdown_support' );
	function your_prefix_add_markdown_support(){
		add_post_type_support( 'your-post-type', 'markdown-osi' );
	}

Note that posts and pages are supported by default.

= How do I convert an existing post to Markdown? =

There is an experimental checkbox in the post editor to convert your old HTML post to Markdown using [Markdownify](http://milianw.de/projects/markdownify/). **Check it at your own risk.** Make sure you have revisions on or backups. If you're relying on specifically crafted HTML, it might get destroyed. But it might be cool.

= What if I don't want to see that Markdown meta box at all? =

I see you love Markdown greatly. You have chosen wisely. Add the following constant to your wp-config.php file:

	define( 'SD_HIDE_MARKDOWN_BOX', true );

Note that you can still disable Markdown formatting with a `<!--no-markdown-->` HTML comment. HTML to Markdown conversion will be impossible.

= What happens if I decide I don't want this plugin anymore? =

Just deactivate it. The Markdown version is stored separately, so without the plugin, you'll just revert to editing the HTML version.
